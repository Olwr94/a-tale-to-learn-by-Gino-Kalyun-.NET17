When Mr.Guy grew lonesome, it wasn't a lot that could turn his frown upside down..
The only thing that him up in the morning was the roar of the dragon and the sweet satisfaction of justice..
After a few weeks of living on the land and having rum to keep you warm at night, Mr.Guy came across a a damsel in distress.
He quickly jumped up and ran towards the scream..

When he finally arrived at the door of the screams, Mr.Guy kicked in the door and came across the beast with a two backs!
Geralt, with the size of his own, does not get affected by the beast size. But instead he feels challenged.
Guy drew his mighty sword with Geralt at his side and joined the fight to save the damsel in distress.

After a 45 min battle, Mr.GUY and the woman laid down exhausted as they knew, the beast was no more..

The woman turnd and said:
-My name is Crystal, like the champagene. Thank you for helping out, I feel warm inside thinking there are people like you still out there.

Mr.Guy turned and said:
-Helping people in situations like this is my passion! No need to thank me.

They both fell asleep after that.. The battle took a lot of energy from them both.
