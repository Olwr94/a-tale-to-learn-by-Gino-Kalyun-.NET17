When he finally met the royal family, they were very afraid of the mighty dragon of which spread fear through the land.

He vowed to capture the dragon and restore the kingdom to it's peaceful former glory.

Once he hed out, he looked back and knew that he might not be coming back after this battle..
Mr.Guy shed a tear fell down his face, the spirit whiped it and they headed towards the kingdoms walls to hunt the mighty best.

After a few days of observing the dragon and it's behavior, Mr.Guy saw that the dragon was no threat to him or the kingdom.

He walked slowly up to the dragon, ready to lay out his life if it came to that.
But the dragon approached slowly and afraid, but still brave..
Thats when Mr.Guy knew that this was no beast, but a misunderstood creature.
