This is a journey with three villains. The first, a wardriven elf. The second a wonderbeast who put skulls on a shelf. 
And the last but not least, a firebreathing dragon who befriended the hero of the realm. The elf is hideous and sneaky. The wonderbeast
is enormous and gnarly. The dragon is curious and brave, but yet very causious.
