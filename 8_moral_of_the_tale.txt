When Mr.Guy finally arrived at the kingdom of Cornwood, he got escorted by the Kingdoms royal guards to the palace of which he would meet the King and queen of this beautiful kingdom.
When he finally met the royal family, they were very afraid of the mighty dragon of which spread fear through the land.

He vowed to capture the dragon and restore the kingdom to it's peaceful former glory.

Once he hed out, it took no more than 10 days until the mighty hero came back with the ferocious dragon, but not captured..
The royal family looked afraid and demanded a explanation!

Mr.Guy stood there beside the dragon thinking how he could explain without sounding crazy.
He paused for a while and then said:
-This dragon is not a threat to me or the kingdom, whe have acquired a partnership.

Everyone in the room gasped..

Mr.Guy then continued to explain how the partnership came to be.

And then he said loud and proud:
-I will not and can not hurt this creature, no one deserves to die because they look scary.
He continued:
-This is a loving creature, and I will ride him into battle, we are loyal to the safety of all and nothing can stop us now.
